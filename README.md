# Cryptography
- Cryptography is the process of hiding or coding information so that only the person a message was intended for can read it.
- The art of cryptography has been used to code messages for thousands of years and continues to be used in bank cards, computer passwords, and ecommerce.
- Modern cryptography techniques include algorithms and ciphers that enable the encryption and decryption of information, such as 128-bit and 256-bit encryption keys.
- Modern ciphers, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), are considered virtually unbreakable.

# Text Cryptography
- Cryptography is the process of converting between readable text, called plaintext, and an unreadable form, called ciphertext.
- This occurs as follows:
  The sender converts the plaintext message to ciphertext. This part of the process is called encryption (sometimes encipherment ).
  The ciphertext is transmitted to the receiver.
  The receiver converts the ciphertext message back to its plaintext form. This part of the process is called decryption (sometimes decipherment ).

# Image Cryptography
- In this image cryptographt images encrypts and the result is in binary numbers.
- To get the image the reciever needs to decrypt it using those binary numbers, then the original image will be achieved.
